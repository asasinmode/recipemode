## how to

1. Boil rice couple of hours in advance. Spread on a baking tray and leave to dry out.
2. Take peas out of the freezer.
3. Mix both soy sauces, sesame oil and fish sauce in a glass or a bowl.
4. Whisk eggs & spices of choice in a bowl.
5. Heat up a wok with a drizzle of oil. Once hot, throw in aromatics (ginger, garlic, chili peppers). Fry until they start to get some color.
6. Add in green onions and carrots. Saute until cooked but still toothsome.
7. Move vegetables onto a plate/different pan.
8. Add oil to wok, once hot, add in the rice and fry until some grains start jumping.
9. Move rice to a side and wok so that only one part of it is being heated.
10. Add oil to prepared side of wok. Add eggs. Let eggs cook a bit at the bottom then scrape to create sheets until all of the eggs are cooked. Try not to get eggs & rice mixed up at that point.
11. Once eggs are cooked, chop them into bite sized chunks. Mix with rice.
12. Create some empty space around the edge of your wok. Pour the sauce around the edge to boil it off a little. Mix everything.
13. Add the vegetables back in. Lower the heat. Mix in frozen peas. Keep cooking until everything heats back up again to your desired temperature.
