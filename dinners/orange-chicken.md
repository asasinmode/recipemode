## how to

1. Cut the chicken into medium-large cubes. Put into a bowl with 50g soy sauce, 50g mirin and 8g baking soda. Let marinade for at least 20 minutes, ideally while preparing everything else.
2. Into bowl 1, add 100g of flour.
3. Into bowl 2, add 400g flour, 400g corn starch, salt and 1 tbsp of pepper / cayenne. Mix thoroughly.
4. Into bowl 3, add ¼ of the above mixture and enough water to get a loose pancake batter consistency.
5. Drizzle some of bowl 3 batter back into bowl 2 to create flakes.
6. Into a small bowl, add and mix all the sauce ingredients (rest of soy sauce and mirin, sugar, rice vinegar, sesame oil, fish sauce, stock cube, juice of 3 and zest of 2 oranges).
6. Into a pan big enough to fit all of the fried chicken, add the aromatics with a drizzle of oil. Put it to the side.
7. Sync coating chicken in the batter with heating up oil to 300°F.
8. Take out the chicken from marinade and, with as little of the marinade as possible, coat it in the flour in bowl 1.
9. Coat in the batter from bowl 3, then add into the mix from bowl 2.
10. Fry the battered chicken in the heated oil until cooked inside.
11. Take out the fried chicken onto paper towels.
12. Once all of the chicken is fried, heat up the oil to 350°F.
13. Fry the chicken again for 1 minute until golden brown.
14. Into a glass or a bowl add 8g of corn starch and some water to make a slurry.
15. Toast the aromatics until they get some color.
16. Pour in the rest of sauce ingredients and let come up to a boil.
17. Once the sauce is boiling, add enough corn starch slurry (might not need all of it, might need more, depends on how much of the sauce has evaporated).
18. When sauce is thickened, add in the fried chicken and mix until coated.
