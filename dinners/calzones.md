### 250°C 9 min

## how to

1. Prepare the tomato sauce and pizza dough in advance.
2. The default pizza dough should be enough for 6/7 calzone balls. Divide it into the chosen number and let proof for 30 minutes.
3. Tomato sauce can either be added inside before baking or poured on top after calzones are ready. If you prefer it inside, make sure it's cooled.
3. For the onion and pepper filling, cut either into thin strips or dice (whichever you prefer to encounter while eating). Add everything into a pan and saute until not raw. Season to taste.
4. Shred the cheeses. I recommend putting them inside a freezer for ~15 minutes before shredding.
4. Everything you add inside the dough should be cooled down.
5. One by one roll the dough balls out into circles. On one half of the dough, with half a centimeter of space around the edge, put: cheese, salami, onion and pepper filling, anything else you chose, onion and pepper filling, salami, cheese.
6. Wrap everything with other half of the dough and join at the edge.
7. Bake for 9 minutes at 250°C.
