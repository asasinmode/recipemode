## how to

1. Finely dice onion and chili peppers, press the garlic.
2. Dice the bell peppers.
3. Add a splash of oil to a big pan/pot. Once hot, add all of the grounded meat.
4. On high heat, brown the meat. Don't mix until the bottom is browned.
5. Mix the meat until fully cooked. Don't over brown it.
6. Turn down the heat, add in the aromatics (onion, garlic, chili peppers) and salt.
7. When aromatics start to get some color, add in the spices (cumin, chili powder, oregano, garlic powder) and toast for 30 seconds.
8. Add in the bell peppers and bay leaves. Optional splash of water if the pan is looking too dry. Cook until the pan dries out again.
9. Add in the crushed tomatoes, stock cube, fish sauce and flour. Let cook for couple of minutes.
10. Add in the canned beans (without the liquid). Add enough water so that everything can simmer for at least 15 more minutes.
