# white chocolate filling

I usually use it as a [macarons](base) filling that surrounds [chocolate ganache](chocolate-ganache).

Default amount of ingredients should be enough for macarons made with 3 egg whites if used only for the outer filling ring.

## total ingredients

- 100g white chocolate
- 55ml 30% cream
