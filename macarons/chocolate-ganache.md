# chocolate ganache

I usually use it as a [macarons](base) filling that's surrounded by [white chocolate filling](white-chocolate-filling).

Default amount of ingredients should be enough for macarons made with 3 egg whites.

## total ingredients

- 30g dark chocolate
- 30ml 30% cream

## ingredients by use case & order

- 30g dark chocolate
- 30ml 30% cream

## how to

1. Melt the chocolate and the cream together. Heat only until it's combined.
2. Let come down to refrigerator temperature. Optionally freeze it to make handling it easier.
