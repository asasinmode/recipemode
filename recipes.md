# recipes

Most recipes follow the structure below.

## total ingredients

Everything you are going to need, kitchen utensils excluded.

## ingredients by use case & order

All of the ingredients grouped by their use case and sorted by the order I find best to handle/prepare/combine them. Useful if you know the directions, have all the ingredients and just need a something you can quickly glance on for reference.

Example for a cake recipe that requires you to prepare dry and wet ingredients in 2 separate bowls before combining them and uses a bit of the same ingredient in dry and for frosting.

- dry ingredient 1
- dry ingredient 2
- 250g of dry ingredient 3
---
- wet ingredient 1
- wet ingredient 2
---
- frosting ingredient 1
- 150g of dry ingredient 3

## how to

Instructions on how to prepare the dish. These are made for a future me that (hopefully) somewhat remembers what has to be done. If you somehow stumbled onto this page and have a question, DM me on twitter or discord.

## sources

Links to recipes/youtube videos I originally got the recipes from. Some recipes lost their source to time. Most recipes are unmodified versions of their source.
