## how to

1. Into a sauce pan (needs to fit all of the ingredients) add milk, gelatine, salt, vanilla and sugar. Heat everything up on a small heat until sugar and gelatine dissolves.
2. Mix in the cream.
3. Pour into serving containers of choice.
4. Refrigerate until set, around 2 hours.

### (optional) sauce

1. Into a pan add all of your fruit and sugar.
2. Heat up and simmer while mixing occasionally (be careful not to burn) until it thickens. It should still be runny but it will thicken more while it cools.
3. Pass through a sieve to get rid of all the solids.
4. Once cooled, pour on top of set panna cotta.
