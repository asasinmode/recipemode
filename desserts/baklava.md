### 200°C 30-35 min

## how to

1. In a saucepan add all syrup ingredients: water, sugar, pinch of salt, honey, orange peel and juice, cinnamon stick. Leave be for now.
2. Partially grind walnuts and spices: cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice. There should still be a decent amount of chunks.
3. Start preheating the oven to 200°C. I do it after I finish the first half of baklava layers, before layering on the nuts, but maybe you do it faster.
4. Melt the butter with a small pinch of salt (reheat as needed if it starts to solidify while assembling the baklava).
5. Layer half of your filo dough while brushing every layer with melted butter. Aim for at least 12 layers on top and bottom (24 total).
6. Spread the nuts on top evenly.
7. Layer the remaining filo dough in the same manner: dough, butter, dough, butter.
8. Once finished, cut the baklava into preferred size pieces.
9. Start a small-medium fire under the syrup.
10. Bake for 30-35 minutes at 200°C.
11. While the baklava bakes, check in on the syrup every couple of minutes. It needs to boil for a bit until it reaches the syrup consistency, around 20-25 minutes. Refer to the videos in [sources](#sources) for what it should look like.
12. When the syrup is ready, turn the heat off and leave it be.
13. After taking out the baklava out of the oven evenly pour the syrup over it.
