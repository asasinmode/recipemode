# tres leches

::: warning
I forgot the exact amount of whipping cream. It needs to cover 2 sponge cakes stacked on top of each other.

Will update the recipe once I remake it.

## total ingredients

- 200g sugar
- 5 eggs
- 80g milk
- vanilla
- 138g flour
- salt
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 300ml (?) 30% cream
- 200g dulce de leche
- 530g sweetened condensed milk
- 2 tbsp powdered sugar

## ingredients by use case & order

- 100g sugar
- 5 yolks
- 80g milk
- vanilla
- 138g flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
---
- 5 whites
- 100g sugar
- salt
---
- 530g sweetened condensed milk
---
- 200g dulce de leche
- 300ml (?) 30% cream
- 2 tbsp powdered sugar

### 175°C 27 min

## how to

1. Into 2 mixing bowls separate the whites and the yolks.
2. Into the yolks bowl add 100g of sugar and cream.
3. Whisk in milk and vanilla.
4. Sift in flour and baking powder, mix until just combined.
5. To the whites bowl, add the rest of the sugar and salt. Whisk until stiff peaks.
6. Fold in the beaten whites into the yolks.
7. Pour the cake mixture into 2 (or 1 if you prefer a single bigger layer, I'm assuming 2) buttered cake moulds.
8. Bake for 27 minutes at 175°C. A skewer inserted into the middle should come out clean.
9. Leave in the oven with the door slightly opened for ~15 minutes. Afterwards take out and let cool completely.
10. Once cooled, leave in the moulds and stab many times with a fork to create holes.
11. Pour all of the sweetened condensed milk evenly onto both layers. Might have to be done in 2 series, cake should absorb everything.
12. Spread an even layer of dulce de leche on top of one layer. Stack another layer on top of it, then cover the top of it with dulce de leche as well.
13. Whip up the cream, spread on top of the whole cake.
