## how to

1. Butter a mould of choice. The default amount of ingredients should cover the bottom of a round cake pan with a diameter of 24cm (~450cm<sup>2</sup>).
2. Crush the graham crackers. I recommend using mortar and pestle. Put into a bowl.
3. Mix in the sugar and, if you want to, cinnamon to taste.
4. Melt butter.
5. Transfer the mixture to the buttered mould. Spread evenly, I recommend using a bottom of a glass.
